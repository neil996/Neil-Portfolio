# [Project 1:Analyzing Covid-19 Deaths in Patients with Different Conditions among Various Counties in the United States of America](https://github.com/neil996/Factors-affecting-Covid-19.)

* The project aims to generalize the effects of Novel coronavirus across different counties in United States Of America and moreover discuss various different factors affecting the same. We have taken into account multiple age factors which are getting affected due to the virus and moreover takes into account different condition factors. The project looks to find distinct and diverse factors in various age groups, i.e. how they are impacting Covid deaths and cases across various regions in United States. The domain of the datasets is related to health care as discussed above the project aims to identify the impact of Covid. The datasets have been selected to take into account all these factors so as to combine diverse factors to get a generalized sense from the available data. The data is obtained mainly from Centre for Disease Control and Prevention which is Federal organization collecting data on daily or random basis as per their availability, moreover as per their description states and local authorities reports the cases regularly to keep the data up to date.

* Regression Techniques Implemented:

1.	XGBoost
2.	Random Forest
3.	Multiple Linear Regression
4.	Decision Tree

* Classification Models Implemented:

1.	KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor)
2.	SVC(Support Vector Classification)

# Data Pre-processing

* To analyze the Null values in a more quantitative and generalized manner, we use different packages such as naniar which can give the number of missing values by plotting it and thus giving us a visualization to get more insights,fig. shows the implementation of naniar package

* VIM (Visualization and Imputation of Missing Values) package helps to visualize the missing data in a deep way and thus can help to apply specific mechanisms which can be helpful in analyzing the missing values and deciding whether to impute/replace or remove it, while Fig Shows the implementation of VIM package.
