# [Project 1:Analyzing Covid-19 Deaths in Patients with Different Conditions among Various Counties in the United States of America](https://github.com/neil996/Factors-affecting-Covid-19.)

* The project aims to generalize the effects of Novel coronavirus across different counties in United States Of America and moreover discuss various different factors affecting the same.
